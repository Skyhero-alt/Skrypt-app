# This web application was made while completing the **Metaverse ReactJS Challenge**
**(this project is now deprecated)**

This application provides you with a global chatroom where anyone can login and enter their messages

This website was made using `NextJs`, `ReactJs` and `Moralis.io`.

Check out the live site at: https://skrypt-app.vercel.app/

To use this web application, you need to have a metamask wallet to login to the web application

## What did I learn about while making this:
- To use React based components
- To use Moralis.io for wallet authentication and as a Database for the application
- To deploy my first site on vercel
